## README

* Please **carefully** follow the instructions given in this template
  code
* Only edit within the allowed sections as instructed by the
  comments; you are risking your own assignment grade if you make
  edits outside those sections or deviate from the instructions
* The testing script provided at the end only performs some basic
  tests; it DOES NOT imply anything about your assignment grade
  * You may add your own tesing code in the main function while working
    on your assignment
  * **However**, you will need to remove your own testing code, and
    re-run the original testing script right before you submit the
    code, to ensure your code is free from syntax errors
* If you are using the Colab notebook version, after you finished your work, please download this notebook as **python** file
  (not notebook file)
  * on menu bar (Colab's menu bar, NOT your browser's menu bar), go to File -> Download -> Download .py
